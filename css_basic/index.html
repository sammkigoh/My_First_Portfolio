					This week has been an exciting journey into the world of
					HTML. This week has been an exciting journey into the world

				<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
				<p>
					As we wrap up the first week, I'm excited about the
					possibilities that HTML offers. This foundational knowledge
					sets the stage for more advanced topics in web development.
					The journey has just begun, and I'm looking forward to
					delving deeper into CSS and JavaScript in the coming weeks.
					Overall, this week has been a mix of learning,
					experimenting, and discovering the joy of creating something
					from scratch. Thank you ALX for making this dream possible
